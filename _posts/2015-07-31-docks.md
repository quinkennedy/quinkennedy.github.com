Starwood Retail wanted the LAB at Rockwell Group to create a series of digital interventions in a few malls that they were revitalizing and renovating. The LAB decided to take the "parkscape" theme that Starwood was using for the general brand image and turn it into an interactive and physical installation in the central atrium of this mall.

I worked mainly as a Creative Technologist on this project:

* Ensured that the designs were feasible given the technology available. 
* Putting together Rough Order of Magnitude costing. 
* Assembling budgets alongside architects and interior designers. 
* Staffing for various visual and technical prototyping efforts.
