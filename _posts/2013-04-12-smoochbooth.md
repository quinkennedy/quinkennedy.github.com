At [Art Hack Day: Larger than Life](http://arthackday.net/events/larger-than-life)
in Stockholm I created an android with extra large arms.
The arms were painted on the wall and an opposite post
that were about 9 feet apart.
If you "completed the circuit" it would snap your picture.
The piece encouraged people to touch each other
and explore the installation together.
