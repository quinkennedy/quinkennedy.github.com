Using real-time weather data and a software algorithm, Ocean Poems 000001 constructs poems that interpret local weather patterns. Each poem is a one-time composition that will likely never occur again. This work takes a fun approach to expressing data, asking viewers to consider the way that we interact with the information that surrounds us all.

## My Role & Responsibilities

I developed a series of scripts which expose and visualize the weather data which is feeding into the installation. These scripts run on Raspberry Pi computers and small monitors embedded in a vitrine inset into the floor.

I was also responsible for configuring all the systems for long-term installation, and consulting on defensive techniques for programming the poetry system to ensure long-term stability.
