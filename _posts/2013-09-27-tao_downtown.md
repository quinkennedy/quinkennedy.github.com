_TAO: Downtown_ is a beautiful restaurant in the Meatpacking District of NYC. The centerpiece of this restaurant is a 16&#39; tall Guanyin statue which has projection-mapped content that cycles throughout the evening.

I worked as a Developer on this project to create a custom video scheduling program which would allow you to define a sequence of videos to play, automate control of VDMX and architectural lighting, and be able to be overridden by a VJ. I also helped fine-tune content to match the statue and set up the system for completely automated running, including boot up and shut down.

* Create custom software for automating VJ software
* Configure and install computer and network on-site
* Create VJ interface for controlling playback remotely
