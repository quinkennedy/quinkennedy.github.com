A surveillance system set up behind a reflective window. The system captures pictures of people and redacts some of the faces in the scene, then prints out the sanitized image on a small printer descretely mounted in the corner of the window.

Originally created for [Art Hack Day: Going Dark](http://www.arthackday.net/events/going-dark) in Berlin, Germany.
