We build a prototype medical device to be used in user testing to validate and compare various user input and feedback options.

## My Role & Responsibilities
I iterated on an existing technical prototype to add features and improve fidelity for subsequent user research sessions.
I was responsible for the technical execution including:

* hardware: I selected components based on availability and requirements, designed a custom PCB stack, collaborated with an industrial designer to integrate the electronics with the physical design
* functionality: I wrote custom firmware to take user input and provide feedback via buttons, lights, embedded displays, and speakers
* control: I implemented a bluetooth-connected remote control interface for managing different user scenario options.
