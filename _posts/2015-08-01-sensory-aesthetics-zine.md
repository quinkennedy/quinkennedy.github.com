For Foo Camp 2015, [Josh](https://twitter.com/brunchstorm) and [James](https://twitter.com/jamestichenor) were excited to create a zine to hand out and share their perspective on the future of computers. Josh and I are both interested in automated design and generative aesthetics, so we decided to start creating a software system for generative zines.

The version that was used for this zine is more programmatically laid-out than generative. It does include variable replacement for per-zine customization. We are planning on continuing to develop this program to move toward a constraint-based and generative system.
