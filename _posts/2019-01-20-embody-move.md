Embody:Move is a virtual reality experience developed with lululemon to explore the possibility of introducing people to a movement practice through an immersive environment.

The experience is inspired by movement practices such as yoga and tai chi. You are placed in naturalistic environments and invited to follow along with a guide performing various movements or poses. As you move, the environment responds and grows around you.

Embody:Move was premiered at Sundance as part of the New Frontiers program, and was shown at SXSW.

## My Role & Responsibilities
I assisted with development and system architecture. One of the areas I owned was transforming OpenPose data into high-level pose quality measurements for use within the system.
