brief: "Intel Labs and the Lab at Rockwell Group co-sponsored the Make Your World booth, a playful environment for kids to learn about basic circuits and interactivity.

The walls of the booth held an assortment of Arduinos, lights, motors, and audio outputs, accessed via small gold terminals sticking out of the wood. Visitors to the booth were given alligator-clip wires that allowed them to complete the circuits by connecting terminals and seeing the effect in the space: blinking lights, spinning objects, funny sounds, and more."
