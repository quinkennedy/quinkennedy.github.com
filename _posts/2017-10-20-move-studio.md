Move Studio is a Virtual Reality experience that incorporates dance and basketball movement phrases in a series of abstract environments. Both you and the avatars around you effect the various environments as you each move in the space.

There are two parts to the application. The first is a demo experience that transports you through four environments. In each environment there are new ways of interacting with your surroundings, and the choreography is all around you. The second part of the application is a sandbox creation space where you can stage and play your own choreography.

Move Studio was commissioned by Microsoft to be featured as a demo experience for the Microsoft Mixed Reality headsets at partner retail outlets worldwide.
