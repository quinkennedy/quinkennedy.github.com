A pop-up art arcade for [Faile](http://faile.net/) and [Bast](http://www.bastny.com/). The cabinets themselves used original hardware from 1985-95 that were covered in posters and paint by the artists. I worked with a number of other developers to translate their visual work and ideas into a set of game-like interactive pieces. Some of the games and cabinets I worked on have been shown:

* During Art Basel 2013 in Miami Beach, FL
* During the Edinburgh Art Festival 2014
* At Faile&#39;s exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in 2015

I worked as a Developer:

* Designing games with Faile, using their artwork as inspiration
* Retrofitting old arcade cabinets with new controls and wiring
    - Including writing custom Arduino code for unique controls
* Developing games in HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Managing computer configuration and deployment
