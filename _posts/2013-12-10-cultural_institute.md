A 12-computer media wall displaying assets and exhibits from the Google Cultural Institute&#39;s collection.

I worked as a Developer on this project:

* Managing and integrating backend deployment and communication infrastructure
* Porting the web experience to work across the 12 computers driving the media wall
* Troubleshooting latency and sync issues
* On-site installation
