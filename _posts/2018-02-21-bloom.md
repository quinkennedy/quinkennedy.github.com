_Bloom: Open Space_ is a collaborative, spatialized incarnation of Brian Eno's and Peter Chilvers' award-winning _Bloom_ iOS app.

Guests create musical patterns and melodies together simply by tapping in the air. They are immersed in this collaborative audio/visual composition via immersive projection and the HoloLens' augmented reality and spatialized sound.
