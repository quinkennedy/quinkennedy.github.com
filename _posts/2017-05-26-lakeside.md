I explored many ideas while staying at the Lakeside Laboratory. In addition to being a biology field station, the laboratory hosts high school students for the summer.
During my residency I dropped in on many of the classes
and went on literal field trips to collect specimens, count invasive species, and learn about the various biomes around Northern Iowa.
