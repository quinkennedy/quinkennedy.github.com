I explored many ideas while staying at the Lakeside Laboratory. In addition to being a biology field station, the laboratory hosts high school students for the summer.
During my residency I dropped in on many of the classes
and went on literal field trips to collect specimens, count invasive species, and learn about the various biomes around Northern Iowa.

* Used photogrammetry to commemorate recognizable locations around the grounds
* Explored using panoramas to capture the mood and movement in a place
* Trained a machine learning model to convert vector maps from around the world into "Iowa" style satellite maps.
* Created an experiment for visualizing audio recordings of animals in the area
* Explored ideas of non-linear time and deja-vu through video manipulation
* Investigated visualization and sonification of buoy data from the lake
