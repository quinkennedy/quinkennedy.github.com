My artist residency at the [Laboratory](https://laboratoryspokane.com/) in Spokane
culminated in the installation of this interactive art piece. The back of a hatchback was
transformed into a river of words bordered by asphalt. A soft glow emanated from the hatchback,
drawing people nearer. hand "prints" were on the windows, inviting passers-by to touch the car.
The more people interacted with the car, the more words would light up in the river, eventually
revealing the phrase "we will create our own future together."
