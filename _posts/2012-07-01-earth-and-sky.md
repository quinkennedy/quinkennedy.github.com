the LAB at Rockwell Group created a kiosk with paired projection which allowed people to navigate the earth and explore the stars simultaneously.

I worked as a Creative Technologist and Software Developer on the project:

* Helping come up with concept and design
* Creating an OSX version of Liquid Galaxy
* Writing translation scripts to convert commands from terrestrial to astronomical
* Configuring computers for permanent installation and install them on-site
* Video and Photo Documentation
