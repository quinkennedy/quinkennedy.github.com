A Pocket Sketchbook to spark thought and discussion around movement and dance. The booklet has a pair of words on each page which outlines a dimension of movement. The reader is encouraged to illustrate each continuum by drawing on the page, discussing it with friends, or by exploring with their body.

This booklet was created during the [5th Choreographic Coding Lab]() hosted by Motion Bank and UCLA. I organized a series of round-tables and discussions starting with the existing [Trackable Qualities]() work. 

Initially my goal was to create a glossary of terms, but it felt disingenuous codifying and restricting meaning for specific terms. The format of this sketchbook is meant to inspire thought, embodiment, and discussion which will lead to a shared language.

The booklet itself was laid out using a custom Processing sketch derived from the [Sensory Aesthetics Zine 1](/art/2015/08/01/sensory-aesthetics-zine/)
